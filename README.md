# JotDown

JOTDOWN is a minimalist, multi-purpose Field Notes style journal designed to put fewer obstacles between thoughts in your head and words on a screen.
Use the notes, checklist, and dated log to track personal projects, RPG characters, or anything else.
Journaling is a simple concept. Keep it that way with JotDown.

Built along with [this](https://github.com/amaxwellshaffer/jotdown-client) React app.
